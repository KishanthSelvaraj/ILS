            The C4 process (Concern, Cause, Countermeasure, Confirm) offers a
            simplified approach to problem-solving in the workplace, modeled
            after established methods like PDCA. It helps identify and address
            issues effectively for overall improvement.

            Beyond solving problems, the C4 process fosters a culture of
            continuous improvement within the workforce. By focusing on employee
            development alongside problem-solving, organizations can achieve
            greater employee engagement, satisfaction, and confidence.
