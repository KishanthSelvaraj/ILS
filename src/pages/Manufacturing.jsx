                A "lean transformation" refers to the process of implementing

                efficiency, eliminate waste, and deliver greater value to
                customers. The term "lean" originated in the manufacturing
                industry, particularly with Toyota's production system, but it
                has since been applied to various sectors, including services,
                healthcare, and software development.
